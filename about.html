    <h1>A little about me</h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="left-column">
            <p>I have lived in London my whole life up until now as i now live in bristol. Born 
                in Croydon and moved to West Wickham, a small town nearby, at the age of 5. 
                I used to travel into central London alot although it may come to a surprise
                to some but the city has become rather boring in recent years. I have also 
                travelled around the world visiting places such as Vietnam, Australia,
                New Zealand and America.</p>

                <p>Recently i have found enjoyment in trying to create clay models, i am not very good
                at it but you have to start somewhere. My end goal is to be able to create
                stop motion clay animations by creating miniture sets out of cardboard and
                masking tape. I haven't found much time to be able to create these
                but i hope to as i have a long time of university at the start of 2026.
                </p>

                <p>When i was a little younger i had a big passion for playing football,
                    i played for my local team aswell as my school and then went on to play
                    for the Orpington and Bromley district in which i travelled to Jersey
                    to compete with all the other districts around England. I then tried to 
                    play for the county of Kent but was dropped in the first round. :/
                </p>

                <p>I hope to be able to use my time at university to gain skills in an area of work
                    which i have never been in before. I hope to be able to find new hobbies and allow
                    myself to grow as a person.
                </p>
