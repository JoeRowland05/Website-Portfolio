            <p>Hello world, my name is Joe Rowland, I am a junior developer at the
            University of West England. I have been tasked for my first semester
            to create a portfolio website using the knowledge I have gained throughout
            my first 10 weeks at university. I have included 3 graphic compositions
            which have been created using Figma. I have also used Figma to create
            the wireframe for this website.</p>
