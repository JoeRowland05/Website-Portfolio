    <h2 class="introduction">Hello world, my name is Joe Rowland, I am a junior developer at the
        University of West England. I have been tasked for my first semester
        to create a portfolio website using the knowledge i have gained throughout
        my first 10 weeks at university. I have included 3 graphic compositions
        which have been created using Figma. I have also used figma to create
        the wireframe for this website.</h2>
