            <h2>My Storyboard from other work</h2>
            <p>My task was to create a storyboard in preparation for a 2D animation concerning the 
                United Nations sustainability goals.</p>
                <p>I picked 'life Under Water' due to personal interest in the ocean and a belief
                    that this topic would really excel in regards to artistic style. My idea was to 
                    create a stop motion animation using drawings i have done focusing on how
                    laziness or a lack of awareness of small changes we can make to our lives have
                a massive effect on the oceans ecosystem and how that has a knock on effect on us.</p>
                <p>I will create and edit the animation using Adobe after effects in which i will 
                    utilise the opacity feature in combination with keyframes in order to make text or
                    images disappear at different times. This also has to be accompanied by audio, i 
                    will add a voice over to the final composition with the words appearing on screen
                    simaltaneously with them being spoken.</p>
